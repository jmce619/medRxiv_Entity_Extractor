# medRxiv_Entity_Extractor

We are developing a system to automate the retrieval of clinical trial results from recent submissions to the medRxiv research paper archive.

Since the nature of the publicates varies in language structure and methodology presentation (as it is published by different authors, universities, etc..), we are implementing various entity recognition approaches to pick up pertinent data.
