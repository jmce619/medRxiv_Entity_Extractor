These include patients with cancer treated with immune checkpoint blockade and patients with inborn errors of immunity. In this study, we sought to determine whether ABCs found in all these conditions are similar, and whether they enhance or detract from the response to COVID-19 vaccination. We use single cell RNA sequencing to show that ABCs arising from distinct aetiologies have common transcriptional profiles and may be subdivided according to the expression of genes associated with different immune functions, such as the autoimmune regulator (AIRE). Next, we perform detailed longitudinal profiling of the COVID-19 vaccination response in patients and controls. We show that high pre-vaccination ABC frequency correlates with decreased levels of antigen-specific memory B cells, and reduced magnitude and longevity of neutralising capacity against SARS-CoV-2 virus. Potentially contributing to this, ABCs express high levels of the inhibitory FcÎ³RIIB receptor and are distinctive in their ability to bind immune complexes. This could contribute to diminished vaccine responses either directly as result of inhibitory signalling or indirectly via enhanced clearance of immune complexed-antigen. Expansion of ABCs may therefore serve as a biomarker identifying individuals at risk of a suboptimal response to COVID-19 vaccination.",{"entities":[[0,29,"CONCEPT"],[390,411,"CONCEPT"],[419,445,"CONCEPT"],[459,463,"CONCEPT"],[650,677,"CONCEPT"],[696,727,"CONCEPT"],[735,755,"CONCEPT"],[804,906,"Unlabelled"],[912,994,"Unlabelled"],[1029,1033,"CONCEPT"],[1072,1088,"CONCEPT"],[1336,1340,"CONCEPT"]]}],["We aimed to assess the prevalence of asymptomatic cases of monkeypox virus (MPXV) infection among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men and trans women (TW), using a self-sampling strategy.

Current biomarkers to track this evolution are limited, with development of islet autoantibodies marking the onset of autoimmunity and metabolic tests used to detect dysglycemia. Therefore, additional biomarkers are needed to better track disease initiation and progression. Multiple clinical studies have used proteomics to identify biomarker candidates. However, most of the studies were limited to the initial candidate identification, which needs to be further validated and have assays developed for clinical use. Here we curate these studies to help prioritize biomarker candidates for validation studies and to obtain a broader view of processes regulated during disease development.  Methods: This systematic review was registered with Open Science Framework (DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/N8TSA). Using PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic search of proteomics studies of T1D in the PubMed to identify putative protein biomarkers of the disease. Studies that performed mass spectrometry-based untargeted/targeted proteomic analysis of human serum/plasma of control, pre-seroconversion, post-seroconversion, and/or T1D-diagnosed subjects were included. For unbiased screening, 3 reviewers screened all the articles independently using the pre-determined criteria. Results: A total of 13 studies met our inclusion criteria, resulting in the identification of 251 unique proteins, with 27 (11%) being identified across 3 or more studies. The circulating protein biomarkers were found to be enriched in complement, lipid metabolism, and immune response pathways, all of which are found to be dysregulated in different phases of T1D development. We found a subset of 3 proteins (C3, KNG1 & CFAH), 6 proteins (C3, C4A, APOA4, C4B, A2AP & BTD) and 7 proteins (C3, CLUS, APOA4, C6, A2AP, C1R & CFAI) have consistent regulation between multiple studies in samples from individuals at pre-seroconversion, post-seroconversion and post-diagnosis compared to controls, respectively, making them strong candidates for clinical assay development.

Objective: The goals of this study are to establish a baseline of exposure at the state level by measuring PFAS serum levels among a representative sample of Wisconsin residents and compare to United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Methods: The study sample included 605 adults (18+ years of age) selected from the 2014-2016 sample of the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW). Thirty-eight PFAS serum concentrations were measured using high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometric detection (HPLC-MS/MS) and geometric means presented. Weighted geometric mean serum values of eight PFAS analytes from SHOW were compared to U.S. national levels from the NHANES 2015-2016 sample (PFOS, PFOA, PFNA, PFHxS, PFHpS, PFDA, PFUnDA), and the 2017-2018 sample for Me-PFOSA, PFHPS using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.  Results: Over 96% of SHOW participants had positive results for PFOS, PFHxS, PFHpS, PFDA, PFNA, and PFOA. In general, SHOW participants had lower serum levels across all PFAS when compared to NHANES. Serum levels increased with age and were higher among males and whites. These trends were seen in NHANES, except non-whites had higher PFAS levels at higher percentiles.

Early treatment with this antiviral has showed to reduce COVID-19 hospitalization and death in unvaccinated outpatients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and high risk of progression to severe disease with variants before Omicron. However, the current epidemiological context and the level of immunity in the population (vaccination and/or natural infection) have evolved considerably since the disclosure of these results. Thus, real-world evidence studies in vaccinated outpatients with lineage and sublineage of the variant are needed.  Objective To assess whether nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment reduces the risk of COVID-19-associated hospitalization among QuÃ©bec outpatients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 at high risk of progression to severe disease in a real-world context, regardless of vaccination status and circulating variants, in the province of QuÃ©bec.  Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of SARS-CoV-2-infected outpatients who received nirmatrelvir/ritonavir between March 15 and August 15, 2022, using data from the QuÃ©bec provincial clinico-administrative databases. Outpatients treated with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir were compared to unexposed ones. The treatment group was matched with controls using propensity-score matching in a ratio of 1:1. The outcome was COVID-19-associated hospitalization occurring within 30 days following the index date. Poisson regression with robust error variance was used to estimate the relative risk of hospitalization among the treatment group compared to the control group.   Results A total of 16,601 and 242,341 outpatients were eligible to be included in the treatment (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) and control groups respectively. Among treated outpatients, 8,402 were matched to controls. Regardless of vaccination status, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir-treated outpatient status was associated with a 69% reduced relative risk of COVID-19-associated hospitalization (RR: 0.31 [95% CI: 0.28; 0.36]). The effect was more pronounced in outpatients without a complete primary vaccination course (RR: 0.04 [95% CI: 0.03; 0.06]), while treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was not associated with benefit when outpatients with a complete primary vaccination course were considered (RR: 0.93 [95% CI: 0.78; 1.08]) Subgroups analysis among outpatients with a primary vaccination course showed that nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment was associated with a significant decrease in relative risk of hospitalization in severely immunocompromised outpatients (RR: 0.66 [95% CI: 0.50; 0.89]) and in outpatients aged 70 years and older (RR: 0.50 [95% CI: 0.34; 0.74]) when the last dose of the vaccine was received more than six months before.  Conclusions Among SARS-CoV-2 infected outpatients at high risk for severe COVID-19 during Omicron BA.2 and BA.4/5 surges, treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was associated with a significant reduced relative risk of COVID-19-associated hospitalization. This effect was observed in outpatients with incomplete primary vaccination course and in outpatients who were severely immunocompromised. Except for severely immunocompromised outpatients, no evidence of benefit was found in any category of outpatient with a complete primary vaccination course whose last dose of COVID-19 vaccine was received within six months.",{"entities":[[27,62,"CONCEPT"],[107,118,"CONCEPT"],[176,184,"CONCEPT"],[261,269,"CONCEPT"],[338,346,"CONCEPT"],[737,756,"CONCEPT"],[820,828,"CONCEPT"],[1036,1055,"CONCEPT"],[1081,1103,"CONCEPT"],[1239,1261,"CONCEPT"],[1214,1294,"METHOD_SUMM"],[1408,1427,"CONCEPT"],[1755,1777,"CONCEPT"],[1905,1935,"CONCEPT"],[1976,2001,"RESULTS"],[2005,2024,"CONCEPT"],[2041,2072,"CONF_INT"],[2166,2197,"CONF_INT"],[2220,2242,"CONCEPT"],[2351,2382,"CONF_INT"],[2466,2488,"CONCEPT"],[2620,2651,"CONF_INT"],[2695,2726,"CONF_INT"],[2822,2832,"CONCEPT"],[2878,2886,"CONCEPT"],[2894,2906,"CONCEPT"],[2911,2917,"CONCEPT"],[2941,2963,"CONCEPT"],[3023,3042,"CONCEPT"],[2926,3059,"CONC_SUMM"],[3375,3383,"CONCEPT"]]}],["Objective: To investigate the diagnostic and prognostic role of gastric fluid DNA (gfDNA) in gasric cancer (GC) patients and controls submitted to upper digestive endoscopy. Design: The concentration of gfDNA was evaluated in 941 samples, including subjects with normal gastric mucosa (n = 10), peptic diseases (n = 596), pre-neoplastic conditions (n = 99), and cancer (n = 236). gfDNA levels were evaluated according to age, gender, BMI, gastric fluids pH, use of proton-pump inhibitors, GC tumor subtypes, histological grades, clinical stages, and disease progression/outcome. Results: In the non-cancer group, we observed that gfDNA levels are increased in women as compared to men (p=7.44e-4). Remarkably, gfDNA levels are increased in GC patients as compared to non-GC (normal + peptic diseases, p=5.67e-13) and in GC versus pre-neoplastic disease (p=1.53e-6). Similar differences were also seen when more advanced tumors (T3) were compared to early stages (T2 and below) (p=5.97-4).

Although valproate use is associated with decreased ischemic stroke risk in observational studies, confounding by indication precludes causal conclusions. To overcome this limitation, we applied Mendelian randomization to determine whether genetic variants that influence clinical response among valproate users associate with ischemic stroke risk in the UK Biobank (UKB). Methods: Using independent genome-wide association data of seizure response after valproate intake from the EpiPGX consortium, a genetic score for valproate response was derived. Valproate users were identified from UKB baseline and primary care data, and the association of the genetic score with incident and recurrent ischemic stroke was tested in Cox proportional hazard models. Results: Among 2,150 valproate users (mean 56 years, 54% females), 82 ischemic strokes occurred over a mean 12-year follow-up. A higher genetic score was associated with an increased effect of valproate dose on serum valproate levels (+0.48 mcg/ml per 100mg/day per one SD, 95%CI[0.28, 0.68]). After adjusting for age and sex, a higher genetic score was associated with lower ischemic stroke risk (HR per one SD 0.73, [0.58, 0.91]) with a halving of absolute risk in the highest compared to the lowest score tertile (4.8% vs 2.5%, p-trend=0.027). In the 194 valproate users with prevalent stroke at baseline, a higher genetic score was associated with lower recurrent ischemic stroke risk (HR per one SD 0.53, [0.32, 0.86]) with reduced absolute risk in the highest compared to the lowest score tertile (3/51, 5.9% vs. 13/71, 18.3%, p-trend=0.026). The genetic score was not associated with ischemic stroke among the 427,997 valproate non-users (p=0.61), suggesting minimal contribution of pleiotropic effects from included genetic variants.  Discussion: Among valproate users, genetically predicted favorable seizure response to valproate was associated with higher valproate levels and reduced ischemic stroke risk, providing causal support for valproate utility in ischemic stroke prevention.
