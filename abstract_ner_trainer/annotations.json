These include patients with cancer treated with immune checkpoint blockade and patients with inborn errors of immunity. In this study, we sought to determine whether ABCs found in all these conditions are similar, and whether they enhance or detract from the response to COVID-19 vaccination. We use single cell RNA sequencing to show that ABCs arising from distinct aetiologies have common transcriptional profiles and may be subdivided according to the expression of genes associated with different immune functions, such as the autoimmune regulator (AIRE). Next, we perform detailed longitudinal profiling of the COVID-19 vaccination response in patients and controls. We show that high pre-vaccination ABC frequency correlates with decreased levels of antigen-specific memory B cells, and reduced magnitude and longevity of neutralising capacity against SARS-CoV-2 virus. Potentially contributing to this, ABCs express high levels of the inhibitory FcÎ³RIIB receptor and are distinctive in their ability to bind immune complexes. This could contribute to diminished vaccine responses either directly as result of inhibitory signalling or indirectly via enhanced clearance of immune complexed-antigen. Expansion of ABCs may therefore serve as a biomarker identifying individuals at risk of a suboptimal response to COVID-19 vaccination.",{"entities":[[0,29,"CONCEPT"],[257,331,"STUDY_SUMM"],[390,411,"CONCEPT"],[415,534,"METHOD_SUMM"],[650,677,"CONCEPT"],[696,727,"CONCEPT"],[735,755,"CONCEPT"],[804,906,"CONC_SUMM"],[977,987,"CONCEPT"],[1029,1033,"CONCEPT"],[1072,1088,"CONCEPT"],[1336,1340,"CONCEPT"],[1436,1444,"CONCEPT"]]}],["We aimed to assess the prevalence of asymptomatic cases of monkeypox virus (MPXV) infection among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men and trans women (TW), using a self-sampling strategy.

Current biomarkers to track this evolution are limited, with development of islet autoantibodies marking the onset of autoimmunity and metabolic tests used to detect dysglycemia. Therefore, additional biomarkers are needed to better track disease initiation and progression. Multiple clinical studies have used proteomics to identify biomarker candidates. However, most of the studies were limited to the initial candidate identification, which needs to be further validated and have assays developed for clinical use. Here we curate these studies to help prioritize biomarker candidates for validation studies and to obtain a broader view of processes regulated during disease development.  Methods: This systematic review was registered with Open Science Framework (DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/N8TSA). Using PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic search of proteomics studies of T1D in the PubMed to identify putative protein biomarkers of the disease. Studies that performed mass spectrometry-based untargeted/targeted proteomic analysis of human serum/plasma of control, pre-seroconversion, post-seroconversion, and/or T1D-diagnosed subjects were included. For unbiased screening, 3 reviewers screened all the articles independently using the pre-determined criteria. Results: A total of 13 studies met our inclusion criteria, resulting in the identification of 251 unique proteins, with 27 (11%) being identified across 3 or more studies. The circulating protein biomarkers were found to be enriched in complement, lipid metabolism, and immune response pathways, all of which are found to be dysregulated in different phases of T1D development. We found a subset of 3 proteins (C3, KNG1 & CFAH), 6 proteins (C3, C4A, APOA4, C4B, A2AP & BTD) and 7 proteins (C3, CLUS, APOA4, C6, A2AP, C1R & CFAI) have consistent regulation between multiple studies in samples from individuals at pre-seroconversion, post-seroconversion and post-diagnosis compared to controls, respectively, making them strong candidates for clinical assay development.

Early treatment with this antiviral has showed to reduce COVID-19 hospitalization and death in unvaccinated outpatients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and high risk of progression to severe disease with variants before Omicron. However, the current epidemiological context and the level of immunity in the population (vaccination and/or natural infection) have evolved considerably since the disclosure of these results. Thus, real-world evidence studies in vaccinated outpatients with lineage and sublineage of the variant are needed.  Objective To assess whether nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment reduces the risk of COVID-19-associated hospitalization among QuÃ©bec outpatients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 at high risk of progression to severe disease in a real-world context, regardless of vaccination status and circulating variants, in the province of QuÃ©bec.  Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of SARS-CoV-2-infected outpatients who received nirmatrelvir/ritonavir between March 15 and August 15, 2022, using data from the QuÃ©bec provincial clinico-administrative databases. Outpatients treated with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir were compared to unexposed ones. The treatment group was matched with controls using propensity-score matching in a ratio of 1:1. The outcome was COVID-19-associated hospitalization occurring within 30 days following the index date. Poisson regression with robust error variance was used to estimate the relative risk of hospitalization among the treatment group compared to the control group.   Results A total of 16,601 and 242,341 outpatients were eligible to be included in the treatment (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) and control groups respectively. Among treated outpatients, 8,402 were matched to controls. Regardless of vaccination status, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir-treated outpatient status was associated with a 69% reduced relative risk of COVID-19-associated hospitalization (RR: 0.31 [95% CI: 0.28; 0.36]). The effect was more pronounced in outpatients without a complete primary vaccination course (RR: 0.04 [95% CI: 0.03; 0.06]), while treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was not associated with benefit when outpatients with a complete primary vaccination course were considered (RR: 0.93 [95% CI: 0.78; 1.08]) Subgroups analysis among outpatients with a primary vaccination course showed that nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment was associated with a significant decrease in relative risk of hospitalization in severely immunocompromised outpatients (RR: 0.66 [95% CI: 0.50; 0.89]) and in outpatients aged 70 years and older (RR: 0.50 [95% CI: 0.34; 0.74]) when the last dose of the vaccine was received more than six months before.  Conclusions Among SARS-CoV-2 infected outpatients at high risk for severe COVID-19 during Omicron BA.2 and BA.4/5 surges, treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was associated with a significant reduced relative risk of COVID-19-associated hospitalization. This effect was observed in outpatients with incomplete primary vaccination course and in outpatients who were severely immunocompromised. Except for severely immunocompromised outpatients, no evidence of benefit was found in any category of outpatient with a complete primary vaccination course whose last dose of COVID-19 vaccine was received within six months.",{"entities":[[27,62,"CONCEPT"],[107,118,"CONCEPT"],[176,184,"CONCEPT"],[261,269,"CONCEPT"],[338,346,"CONCEPT"],[666,772,"STUDY_SUMM"],[820,828,"CONCEPT"],[1036,1055,"CONCEPT"],[1081,1103,"CONCEPT"],[1214,1383,"METHOD_SUMM"],[1408,1427,"CONCEPT"],[1755,1777,"CONCEPT"],[1905,1935,"CONCEPT"],[1976,2001,"RESULTS"],[2005,2024,"CONCEPT"],[2041,2072,"CONF_INT"],[2166,2197,"CONF_INT"],[2220,2242,"CONCEPT"],[2351,2382,"CONF_INT"],[2466,2488,"CONCEPT"],[2620,2651,"CONF_INT"],[2695,2726,"CONF_INT"],[2822,2832,"CONCEPT"],[2878,2886,"CONCEPT"],[2894,2906,"CONCEPT"],[2911,2917,"CONCEPT"],[2926,3059,"CONC_SUMM"],[3375,3383,"CONCEPT"]]}],["Objective: To investigate the diagnostic and prognostic role of gastric fluid DNA (gfDNA) in gasric cancer (GC) patients and controls submitted to upper digestive endoscopy.

Although valproate use is associated with decreased ischemic stroke risk in observational studies, confounding by indication precludes causal conclusions. To overcome this limitation, we applied Mendelian randomization to determine whether genetic variants that influence clinical response among valproate users associate with ischemic stroke risk in the UK Biobank (UKB). Methods: Using independent genome-wide association data of seizure response after valproate intake from the EpiPGX consortium, a genetic score for valproate response was derived. Valproate users were identified from UKB baseline and primary care data, and the association of the genetic score with incident and recurrent ischemic stroke was tested in Cox proportional hazard models. Results: Among 2,150 valproate users (mean 56 years, 54% females), 82 ischemic strokes occurred over a mean 12-year follow-up. A higher genetic score was associated with an increased effect of valproate dose on serum valproate levels (+0.48 mcg/ml per 100mg/day per one SD, 95%CI[0.28, 0.68]). After adjusting for age and sex, a higher genetic score was associated with lower ischemic stroke risk (HR per one SD 0.73, [0.58, 0.91]) with a halving of absolute risk in the highest compared to the lowest score tertile (4.8% vs 2.5%, p-trend=0.027). In the 194 valproate users with prevalent stroke at baseline, a higher genetic score was associated with lower recurrent ischemic stroke risk (HR per one SD 0.53, [0.32, 0.86]) with reduced absolute risk in the highest compared to the lowest score tertile (3/51, 5.9% vs. 13/71, 18.3%, p-trend=0.026). The genetic score was not associated with ischemic stroke among the 427,997 valproate non-users (p=0.61), suggesting minimal contribution of pleiotropic effects from included genetic variants.  Discussion: Among valproate users, genetically predicted favorable seizure response to valproate was associated with higher valproate levels and reduced ischemic stroke risk, providing causal support for valproate utility in ischemic stroke prevention.

Landscape genetics identifies the ecological features that impact genetic variation between sampling sites. Here, we have used a landscape genetics framework to understand the relationship between environmental features and gene flow of the filarial parasite Onchocerca volvulus and of its intermediate host and vector, blackflies in the genus Simulium. We analysed samples from the ecological transition region separating the savannah and forest ecological regions of Ghana, where the transmission of O.â¯volvulus has persisted despite almost half a century of onchocerciasis control efforts.   Methods: We generated a baseline microfilarial prevalence map from the point estimates of pre-ivermectin microfilarial prevalence from 47 locations in the study area. We analysed mitochondrial data from 164 parasites and 93 blackflies collected from 15 communities and four breeding sites, respectively. We estimated population genetic diversity and identified correlations with environmental variables. Finally, we compared baseline prevalence maps to movement suitability maps that were based on significant environmental variables.   Results: We found that the resistance surfaces derived from elevation (r = 0.793, p = 0.005) and soil moisture (r = 0.507, p = 0.002) were significantly associated with genetic distance between parasite sampling locations. Similarly, for the vector populations, the resistance surfaces derived from soil moisture (r = 0.788, p = 0.0417) and precipitation (r = 0.835, p = 0.0417) were significant. The correlation between the baseline parasite prevalence map and the parasite resistance surface map was stronger than the correlation between baseline prevalence and the vector resistance surface map. The central parts of the transition region which were conducive for both the parasite and the vector gene flow were most strongly associated with high baseline onchocerciasis prevalence.   Conclusions: We present a framework for incorporating environmental, genetic, and prevalence data for identifying when ecological conditions are favourable for onchocerciasis transmission between communities. We identified areas with higher suitability for parasite and vector gene flow, which ultimately might help us gain deeper insights into defining transmission zones for onchocerciasis.

Effect sizes of CNVs on subcortical volume, thickness and local surface area were correlated with their previously reported effect sizes on cognition and risk for ASD and SZ. Shape analyses were able to identify subregional alterations that were averaged out in volume analyses. We identified a common latent dimension - characterized by opposing effects on basal ganglia and limbic structures - across CNVs and across NPDs. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that subcortical alterations associated with CNVs show varying levels of similarities with those associated with neuropsychiatric conditions. We also observed distinct effects with some CNVs clustering with adult conditions while others clustered with ASD. This large cross-CNV and NPDs analysis provide insight into the long-standing questions of why CNVs at different genomic loci increase the risk for the same NPD, as well as why a single CNV increases the risk for a diverse set of NPDs.",{"entities":[[12,38,"CONCEPT"],[55,74,"CONCEPT"],[101,119,"CONCEPT"],[124,152,"CONCEPT"],[163,175,"CONCEPT"],[180,198,"CONCEPT"],[245,249,"CONCEPT"],[404,409,"CONCEPT"],[544,548,"CONCEPT"],[565,570,"CONCEPT"],[580,655,"METHOD_SUMM"],[663,666,"CONCEPT"],[700,706,"CONCEPT"],[708,711,"CONCEPT"],[713,721,"CONCEPT"],[723,730,"CONCEPT"],[732,739,"CONCEPT"],[741,749,"CONCEPT"],[755,762,"CONCEPT"],[868,871,"CONCEPT"],[873,875,"CONCEPT"],[877,881,"CONCEPT"],[883,912,"CONCEPT"],[914,930,"CONCEPT"],[936,953,"CONCEPT"],[963,977,"RESULTS"],[978,982,"CONCEPT"],[1042,1053,"CONCEPT"],[1058,1066,"CONCEPT"],[1089,1094,"CONCEPT"],[1111,1115,"CONCEPT"],[1258,1261,"CONCEPT"],[1266,1269,"CONCEPT"],[1453,1466,"CONCEPT"],[1471,1488,"CONCEPT"],[1498,1502,"CONCEPT"],[1514,1519,"CONCEPT"],[1562,1698,"CONC_SUMM"],[1716,1813,"CONC_SUMM"],[1825,1834,"CONCEPT"],[1839,1843,"CONCEPT"],[1909,1913,"CONCEPT"],[1971,1974,"CONCEPT"],[2000,2003,"CONCEPT"]]}],["Acoustic signal analysis has been employed in various medical devices.

The main objective of this cross-sectional validation study was to develop and validate the Swaasa AI platform to screen and prioritize at risk patients for PTB based on the signature cough sound as well as symptomatic information provided by the subjects. The voluntary cough sound data was collected at Andhra Medical College-India. An Algorithm based on multimodal Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture and Feedforward Artificial Neural Network (FFANN) (tabular features) was built and validated on a total of 567 subjects, comprising 278 positive and 289 negative PTB cases. The output from these two models was combined to detect the likely presence (positive cases) of PTB. In the clinical validation phase, the AI-model was found to be 86.82% accurate in detecting the likely presence of PTB with 90.36% sensitivity and 84.67% specificity. The pilot testing of model was conducted at a peripheral health care centre, RHC Simhachalam-India on 65 presumptive PTB cases. Out of which, 15 subjects truly turned out to be PTB positive with a Positive Predictive Value of 75%. The validation results obtained from the model are quite encouraging. This platform has the potential to fulfil the unmet need of a cost-effective PTB screening method. It works remotely, presents instantaneous results, and does not require a highly trained operator.

Surgical targeting and postoperative programming of DBS depend on the spatial location of the stimulating electrodes in relation to the surrounding anatomical structures and on electrode connectivity to a specific distributed pattern of brain networks. Such information is usually collected using group-level analysis which relies on the availability normative imaging-resources (atlases and connectomes). To this end, analyzing DBS data of children with debilitating neurological disorders like dystonia would make benefit from such resources, especially given the developmental differences between adults and children neuroimaging data. We assembled pediatric, normative neuroimaging-resources from open-access neuroimaging datasets and illustrated their utility on a cohort of children with dystonia treated with pallidal DBS. We aimed to derive a local pallidal sweetspot and explore a connectivity fingerprint associated with pallidal stimulation to exemplify the utility of the assembled imaging resources.  Methods A pediatric average brain template was implemented and used to localize DBS electrodes of twenty patients of the GEPESTIM registry cohort.  Next, a pediatric subcortical atlas was also employed to highlight anatomical structures of interest. Local pallidal sweetspot was modeled and its degree of overlap with stimulation volumes was calculated as a correlate of individual clinical outcome. Additionally, a pediatric functional connectome of neurotypical subjects was built to allow network-based analyses and decipher a connectivity fingerprint responsible for clinical improvement in our cohort.  Results We successfully implemented a pediatric neuroimaging dataset that will be made available to public use as a tool for DBS-analyses. Overlap of stimulation volumes with the identified DBS-sweetspot model correlated significantly with improvement on a local spatial level (R = 0.46, permuted p = 0.019). Functional connectivity fingerprint of DBS-outcome was determined as a network correlate of therapeutic pallidal stimulation in children with dystonia (R = 0.30, permuted p = 0.003).   Conclusions Local sweetspot and distributed network models provide neuroanatomical substrates for DBS-associated clinical outcome in dystonia using pediatric neuroimaging surrogate data.

In this work, we propose a deep learning approach for the development of prognostic models for malignant transformation and their association with clinical outcomes in histology whole slide images (WSIs) of OED tissue sections. We train a weakly supervised method on OED (n= 137) cases with transformation (n= 50) status and mean malignant transformation time of 6.51 years (Â±5.35 SD). Performing stratified 5-fold cross-validation achieves an average AUROC of ~0.78 for predicting malignant transformations in OED. Hotspot analysis reveals various features from nuclei in the epithelium and peri-epithelial tissue to be significant prognostic factors for malignant transformation, including the count of peri-epithelial lymphocytes (PELs) (p < 0.05), epithelial layer nuclei count (NC) (p < 0.05) and basal layer NC (p < 0.05). Progression free survival using the Epithelial layer NC (p < 0.05, C-index = 0.73), Basal layer NC (p < 0.05, C-index = 0.70) and PEL count (p < 0.05, C-index = 0.73) shown association of these features with a high risk of malignant transformation.

Methods: We measured NT-proBNP among adults aged 20 years who participated in the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. In adults without a history of cardiovascular disease, we assessed the prevalence of elevated NT-pro-BNP by blood pressure (BP) treatment and control categories. We examined the extent to which NT-proBNP identifies participants at higher risk for mortality across BP treatment and control categories.  Results: The number of US adults without CVD with elevated NT-proBNP (125 pg/ml) was 6.2 million among those with untreated hypertension, 4.6 million among those with treated controlled hypertension, and 5.4 million among those with treated uncontrolled hypertension. After adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, and race/ethnicity, participants with treated controlled hypertension and elevated NT-proBNP had increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR 2.29, 95% CI 1.79, 2.95) and increased risk of cardiovascular mortality (HR 3.83, 95% CI: 2.34, 6.29), compared to those without hypertension and with low levels of NT-proBNP (<125 pg/ml). Among those on antihypertensive medication, those with SBP 130-139 mm Hg and elevated NT-proBNP had increased risk of all-cause mortality, compared to those with SBP<120 mm Hg and low levels of NT-proBNP.  Conclusions:  Among a general population of adults free of cardiovascular disease, NT-proBNP can provide additional prognostic information within and across categories of BP.
